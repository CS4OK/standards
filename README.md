# Oklahoma Academic Standards for Computer Science

As Oklahoma builds upon the great work happening across Oklahoma in the area of Computer Science, we know there is much to do in the areas of standards, curriculum, professional development, certification, policy analysis, and research. The first step in all of the work is the development of engaging and rigorous K-12 Computer Science standards that **ensure all students engage in meaningful learning that develop their understanding and application of computer science.**

The COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS COMMITTEE will be responsible for conducting a thorough review of existing CS standards and research-based guidance in order to develop Oklahoma's first Computer Science Standards.

The following directory is provided for the benefit of the members of the Computer Science Standards Committee and its sub-committees. While this documentation is public, please respect the work as a process.
