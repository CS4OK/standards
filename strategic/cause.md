# Cause for CS Standards Review

According to Oklahoma state law<sup>1</sup>, the Oklahoma State Board of Education is required to engage in a thorough review and, if necessary, revision of the academic standards within each subject area. The timeline for this review is defined by the subject area textbook adoption cycle<sup>2</sup> situating Computer Education and Instructional Technology as a priority for the Office of Curriculum and Instruction for 2017. The category of Computer Education and Instructional Technology is defined within the textbook adoption cycle to include courses such as *Introduction to Computers, Computer Literacy, Advanced Programming, Business Computer Applications, Computer Programming I-II, AP Computer Science, and Personal Financial Literacy. For the purpose of this plan, Personal Financial Literacy **is not** included here.* Further, the overarching term of Computer Science is used presently to refer to those listed courses and many others that are likely pertinent to the conversation as the landscape of Computer Science and Computational Thinking has greatly changed in the recent years.

For greater context, the term Computer Science is further defined in the recent State of States Landscape Report: State-level Policies Supporting Equitable K-12 Computer Science Education<sup>3</sup>:

>### What is Computer Science?
>*As citizens of the 21st century, students are expected to learn to use digital devices such as computers to assist in gathering, organizing, and analyzing information—skills that are often described in terms of digital literacy. Many students, parents, and teachers confuse the skills related to digital literacy with those related to Computer Science. Computer Science is its own subject area, with deep roots in mathematics and engineering. It focuses on both theoretical and applied approaches to the creation of computational processing. Computer scientists work on the design and development of both hardware and software, applying computing principles to a variety of fields.*

With this distinction in mind, the present strategic plan makes a special effort to address both the expectations found in the textbook adoption cycle and those that are consistent with the current landscape of Computer Science, Computational Thinking, and, to whatever extent possible, Computer Literacy, Educational Technology, Digital Citizenship, and Information Technology (see the What is NOT Computer Science? excerpt below).

>### What is NOT Computer Science?
>*Computer science builds on computer literacy, educational technology, digital citizenship, and information technology. Their differences and relationship with computer science are described below.*
>* _**Computer literacy** refers to the general use of computers and programs, such as productivity software. Previously mentioned examples include performing an Internet search and creating a digital presentation._
>* _**Educational technology** applies computer literacy to school subjects. For example, students in an English class can use a web- based application to collaboratively create, edit, and store an essay online._
>* _**Digital citizenship** refers to the appropriate and responsible use of technology, such as choosing an appropriate password and keeping it secure._
>* _**Information technology** often overlaps with computer science but is mainly focused on industrial applications of computer science, such as installing software rather than creating it. Information technology professionals often have a background in computer science._
