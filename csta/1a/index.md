# 1A-CS Standards

|Standard|Concept|Subconcept|Practice|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|__[1A-CS-01](csta/1a/cs-01.md) Select and operate appropriate software to perform a variety of tasks, and recognize that users have different needs and preferences for the technology they use.__ <br><br>*People use computing devices to perform a variety of tasks accurately and quickly. Students should be able to select the appropriate app/program to use for tasks they are required to complete. For example, if students are asked to draw a picture, they should be able to open and use a drawing app/program to complete this task, or if they are asked to create a presentation, they should be able to open and use presentation software. In addition, with teacher guidance, students should compare and discuss preferences for software with the same primary functionality. Students could compare different web browsers or word processing, presentation, or drawing programs.* <br><br> __Practice(s):__ Fostering an Inclusive Computing Culture: 1.1|Computing Systems|Devices|Inclusion
|__[1A-CS-02](csta/1a/cs-02.md) Use appropriate terminology in identifying and describing the function of common physical components of computing systems (hardware).__ <br><br>*A computing system is composed of hardware and software.Hardware consists of physical components.Students should be able to identify and describe the function of external hardware, such as desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet devices, monitors, keyboards, mice, and printers.* <br><br> __Practice(s):__ Communicating About Computing: 7.2|Computing Systems|Hardware & Software|Communicating
|__[1A-CS-03](csta/1a/cs-03.md) Describe basic hardware and software problems using accurate terminology.__<br><br>*Problems with computing systems have different causes. Students at this level do not need to understand those causes, but they should be able to communicate a problem with accurate terminology (e.g., when an app or program is not working as expected, a device will not turn on, the sound does not work, etc.). Ideally, students would be able to use simple troubleshooting strategies, including turning a device off and on to reboot it, closing and reopening an app, turning on speakers, or plugging in headphones. These are, however, not specified in the standard, because these problems may not occur.* <br><br> __Practice(s):__ Testing and Refining Computational Artifacts, Communicating About Computing: 6.2, 7.2|Computing Systems|Troubleshooting|Testing, Communicating
